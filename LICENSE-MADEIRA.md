# Licensing of this Wine fork (LGPL branch `madeira-lgpl`)

This repository is a fork of [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), which upstream
distributes under **LGPL-2.1-or-later**. This branch keeps that licence.

- Upstream code: LGPL-2.1-or-later, all upstream copyright and licence
  notices unchanged. Baseline: upstream tag `wine-11.4`.
- Modifications and new files authored for
  [Madeira](https://github.com/willfaust/Madeira): **LGPL-2.1-or-later**,
  Copyright (C) 2026 Will Faust, except the third-party contributions
  listed below. The new `dlls/wineios.drv` files are
  derived from upstream `winecoreaudio.drv` and keep its CodeWeavers and
  Huw Davies copyright notices.
- Provenance: the branch was rebuilt from the upstream baseline with the 51
  commits listed in the Madeira repository's `docs/wine-lgpl-provenance.md`,
  cherry-picked from the earlier GPL-converted branch with `-x` (each commit
  message names its origin). Later changes are committed on this branch
  directly. The earlier branch's LGPL-section-3 conversion to
  GPL-3.0 is NOT applied here; that conversion is irreversible for that
  copy, which is why this branch was rebuilt from the upstream baseline
  instead.
- Third-party contributions, **LGPL-2.1-or-later**, copyright retained by
  their authors, each signed off under the DCO (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`):
